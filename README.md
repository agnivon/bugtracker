# Bug Tracker Application Using Node.js And MongoDB:

1. Create a user form to add bug, it should contain following field:
   - Title
   - Description
   - Time (should autofill with system date & time)
   - Date (should autofill with system date & time)
   - Assignee

2. All data created should be saved in MongoDB

3. The data should be entered in table using jQuery (datatable)

4. Build a programming logic for SLA that every bug should be resolved in 3 days, after the third day the unresolved bug should be highlighted

5. Add one more field to show the leftover days to fix the bug (Total time is 3 days from the day bug is assigned)
